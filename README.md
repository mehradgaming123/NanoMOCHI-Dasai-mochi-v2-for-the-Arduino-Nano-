# NanoMOCHI-Dasai-mochi-v2-for-the-Arduino-Nano-
NanoMochi is a project that i made That emulates something like dasai mochi 👓, which is a car companion made by Dasai and Arduino Nano cant handle that many pictures so i have created something like that which shows a intro text and Plays animations randomly either fast or slow. you can test it on a Arduino uno or nano since it has low storage.
